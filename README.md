<h1>vsh</h1>
A Blazingly fast shell made in Rust ðŸ¦€
</div>

#### Why make another shell?
Because the [current leading rust shell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/) is very opinionated, atleast to me. As it brings a lot to the table for someone who just wants a shell but in rust, new `ls` command, new scripting experiece etc. What's needed is just bash but in rust and vsh is there to deliver, the planned scripting language will be a 1:1 copy of bash and all of its features so that people don't feel *homesick* or dropped into a new space when they start using vsh. As the for shell prompt I plan to expand upon it to add plugins to accept a wide array of custom plugins all written in vsh. Till then feel free to contribute yourself!

#### Fonts Needed
Now that the prompt has been given a complete overhaul, you will need need to install nerd fonts to run `vsh` properly. [Click here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to choose your own nerd font, no need to worry as the font that you are used to using should probably have its own nerd font counterpart. I recommend using [Jetbrains Mono Nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/Ligatures/Regular/complete/JetBrains%20Mono%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.ttf) to get started!
